## Some Definitions

#### Number Theory Numbners

- Fibonacci Number
    A quick method to check if a number if Fibonacci number or not, is as below: N is a Fibonacci number if and only if ( 5*N2 + 4 ) or ( 5*N2 – 4 ) is a perfect square! For Example: 3 is a Fibonacci number since (5*3*3 + 4) is 49 which is 7*7.
<br>
- Münchhausen Number
    A Münchhausen number (sometimes spelled Münchausen number, with a single 'h') is a number equal to the sum of its digits raised to each digit's power. 
<br>
- Narcissistic or Armstrong number:
    An n-digit number that is the sum of the  nth powers of its digits is called an n-narcissistic number.
<br>
- Semiperfect Number
    In number theory, a semiperfect number or pseudoperfect number is a natural number n that is equal to the sum of all or some of its proper divisors. A semiperfect number that is equal to the sum of all its proper divisors is a perfect number.

- Odious Number
    An odious number is a nonnegative number that has an odd number of 1s in its binary expansion.
